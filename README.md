# estimation_distribution_algorithms
In this repository are implementations of the following Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDA's): Compact Genetic Algorithm (CGA), Extended-CGA (eCGA) and Bayesian Optimization Algorithm (BOA). Next to the BOA there is also a presentation (in Brazilian Portuguese) about an experiment performed combining two search algorithms for building Bayesian networks (Hill Climbing and Tabu Search) with four tree evaluation metrics, being K2, Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) ), Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) and Bayesian Dirichlet Equivalent (BDS). All source code was developed in R programming language in version 3.5.3 (MRO). If you use the presentation or any of the source code, please include the reference to my name and this repository. I am available to answer any questions by my personal email: ciniro@gmail.com.
